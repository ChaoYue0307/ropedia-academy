# Action anticipation (LSTM)

An LSTM that anticipates the next action from a sequence, well above chance. Best-checkpoint by top-1.

Trained from scratch in **[Ropedia Academy](https://chaoyue0307.github.io/ropedia-academy/)** — an interactive, bilingual course on embodied & spatial AI. **Educational model:** small and quick to train; the value is the *method* and a reproducible pipeline, not a leaderboard score.

## How to use

```python
import torch
state = torch.load("model.pt", map_location="cpu")   # some labs save pose.pt / gaussians.pt / transform.pt
# Rebuild the model class from the Ropedia Academy notebook (linked above), then:
# model.load_state_dict(state)
```

## Reproduce / train your own

Open the [lab notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ChaoYue0307/ropedia-academy/blob/main/notebooks/training/C_action_anticipation_lstm.ipynb) → **Runtime → GPU → Run all**, then its *Publish to the Hugging Face Hub* cell. Browse every lab in the [Ropedia Academy Labs tab](https://chaoyue0307.github.io/ropedia-academy/labs).

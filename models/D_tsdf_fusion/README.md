# TSDF fusion → mesh

> Fuses multi-view depth into a truncated SDF volume and extracts a mesh with marching cubes.

Trained from scratch in **[Ropedia Academy](https://chaoyue0307.github.io/ropedia-academy/)** — an interactive, bilingual course on embodied & spatial AI. **Educational model:** small and quick to train; the value is the *method* and a reproducible pipeline, not a leaderboard score. Try it live in the **[Ropedia demos Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cy0307/ropedia-demos)**.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base model** | Trained **from scratch** (random initialization) — no pretrained base model. |
| **Task** | dense 3D reconstruction |
| **Training objective** | **TSDF integration** of multi-view depth (no gradient training); mesh via marching cubes. |
| **Track** | D · Scene & world models |
| **Notebook** | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ChaoYue0307/ropedia-academy/blob/main/notebooks/training/D_tsdf_fusion.ipynb) |

## Dataset

- **Name:** Synthetic depth views
- **Type:** synthetic — procedural
- **Size / stats:** 1 scene (two spheres); 6 orthographic depth maps fused into a 64³ TSDF grid
- **Split:** single scene
- **Source:** procedural

## Training config

No training — TSDF integration of 6 depth views into a 64³ grid; marching cubes for the mesh.

## Evaluation results

| metric | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `verts` | 27362 |  |
| `faces` | 56058 |  |

## Inference example

```python
import torch
state = torch.load("mesh.pt", map_location="cpu")   # this repo's checkpoint
# Rebuild the exact module from the lab notebook (see "Reproduce"), then:
# model.load_state_dict(state); model.eval()
```

## Limitations

**Educational scale.** Trained quickly on CPU on small or synthetic data, so absolute numbers are not competitive with production systems — the value is the *method* and a reproducible pipeline. No large-scale data, no hyperparameter sweep, and no multi-seed variance is reported. **Not for production use.**

## Failure cases

Sparse views leave holes; a bad truncation distance breaks or over-smooths the surface (marching-cubes arrays need `.copy()`).

## Reproduce / train your own

**One click:** open the notebook in Colab → **Runtime → GPU → Run all**, then run its *Publish to the Hugging Face Hub* cell.

**From a shell:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChaoYue0307/ropedia-academy.git && cd ropedia-academy
pip install torch numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-image gymnasium
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/training/D_tsdf_fusion.ipynb --output run.ipynb
# optional: override training length, e.g.  STEPS=2000  (or EPISODES=600)  before running
```

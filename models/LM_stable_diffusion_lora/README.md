# Stable Diffusion — LoRA / DreamBooth  🚧 not trained yet

> Teach Stable Diffusion a new concept with LoRA / DreamBooth, then generate.

**Status — documented recipe (placeholder).** A production-grade pipeline from **[Ropedia Academy](https://chaoyue0307.github.io/ropedia-academy/)** for an advanced, GPU-heavy task. Everything below — base model, objective, dataset, config, the exact evaluation — is specified; the **weights / metrics / figures** land here automatically when you run the notebook on a GPU (one click below). Try the trained models live in the **[Ropedia demos Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cy0307/ropedia-demos)**.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base model** | runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 (or SDXL) |
| **Task** | text-to-image fine-tuning |
| **Training objective** | LoRA / DreamBooth fine-tuning of the diffusion UNet on new concepts. |
| **Track** | LM · Language & multimodal |
| **Built on** | [huggingface/diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/dreambooth) |
| **Notebook** | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ChaoYue0307/ropedia-academy/blob/main/notebooks/advanced/LM_stable_diffusion_lora.ipynb) |
| **Compute / storage / time** | GPU required — see the *Compute · storage · time* table in the notebook |

## Dataset
- **Source:** Your subject/style images (a few–dozens).

## Training config
GPU-scale — the notebook ships a **demo** profile (free Colab T4) and a **full** profile, with an exact *Compute · storage · time* table. Hyperparameters (optimizer, steps, batch, LoRA rank, …) are in the training cell.

## Evaluation results
⏳ **Pending** — run the notebook on a GPU to fill this in. This lab reports **FID · CLIP score (+ CLIP-I/DINO for subjects)** on a held-out split (see its *Evaluate* cell).

## Inference example
No weights are published yet. After a GPU run, load the checkpoint/adapter the notebook saves (it also has a ready inference cell). Base model: **runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 (or SDXL)**.

## How to fill this repo
1. Open the [notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ChaoYue0307/ropedia-academy/blob/main/notebooks/advanced/LM_stable_diffusion_lora.ipynb) → **Runtime → GPU → Run all** (runs the real pipeline).
2. Run its **Publish to the Hugging Face Hub** step (or `HfApi().upload_folder(...)`) — the checkpoint + `metrics.json` + figures replace this placeholder.

- [ ] Train / run on a GPU · [ ] upload weights · [ ] add `metrics.json` · [ ] add figures · [ ] swap in the real results card

## Limitations
Not yet trained — no numbers to report. The pipeline is **GPU-heavy** (see the compute table); on free Colab use the demo-scale settings. This is an educational, reproducible recipe, not a tuned production release.

## License
Code: **MIT** (this repository). The **base model** ([huggingface/diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/dreambooth)) and **dataset** are each under their own licenses — check the upstream source before redistribution.
